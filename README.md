# Three Move game

A simple and interactive Three Move game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Overview

This project is a basic implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game. Players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid with X or O. The game ends when one player has three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal, or when all spaces are filled and the game is a draw.

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Click on any of the empty boxes to place your mark (X or O).
3. The game will automatically switch between players after each move.
4. The game ends when one player wins or when all spaces are filled (draw).
5. You can start a new game by clicking the "New Game" button or reset the current game with the "Reset Game" button.

## Files Included

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that structures the game.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that styles the game.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that contains the game logic.
